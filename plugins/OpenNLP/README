This directory contains wrappers for the OpenNLP java-based tools for
sentence detection, tokenization, pos-tagging, chunking and parsing,
named-entity detection, and coreference. The tools use the Maxent
machine learning package.

The wrappers use the following libraries:

OpenNLP Java API from http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
OpenNLP Tools from http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
OpenNLP Maxent from http://maxent.sourceforge.net/

All of the above libraries are redistributed here under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1, a copy of which can be
found in the file LICENSE.

By default, the wrappers uses models for English which can be found in
models/english directory.

Thanks are due to Georgi D. Georgiev of Ontotext for wrapping the
OpenNLP tools for GATE, and to the OpenNLP project.
