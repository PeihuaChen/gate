Obsolete Plugins
================

Sometimes plugins are removed from GATE as they have become obsolete. If a
plugin you used to use has disappeared it is probably because it has been
made obsolete.

Obsolete plugins are available via SVN from
https://gate.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gate/plugins/trunk/obsolete
