v1.0_01 Clarified Release (06/12/2003)
======================================
Added a Unix/Linux build script which seems to work, at least under
cygwin on Windows haven't managed to actually test it on a Unix box
yet. Also updated the README file to explain about what other GATE
modules are needed to run the chunker within GATE. And finally I
added this file to the release.

v1.0 First Public Release (05/12/2003)
======================================
Not much to say really it works but hasn't been optimized and some
of the Unix/Linux scripts are missing or untested.
