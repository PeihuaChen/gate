Version 1.1 (Released 26/03/2004)
=================================
This release is to fix a mistake I made in the clean up process which
means the tagger can take a lot longer to run than it really should do
especially on long documents. This version won't tag anything that v1.0
didn't but it will do the job faster!

Version 1.0 (Released 09/02/2004)
=================================
Currently compounds, elements and ions are tagged. Compounds which are
made up only of capital letters are not tagged as it introduces too
many false positives. For the same reason elements appearing as the
first token in a sentence are not tagged.

If a text contains "element token (Compound Formula)" then "element token"
will be tagged as a compound name, e.g. sulphur dioxide is tagged in the
text "sulphur dioxide (SO2)" (note that this also works if the formula is
surrounded by commas instead of parenthesis). Hopefully support for
compound names will be improved in a future release.
