I need to add support for update events to the Lexicons in gate.lexicon and
then make the GUI's to listen to these events and update themselves. Update of words,
synsets and senses is needed. Also, make the OntoLex editor listen for ontology changes
events.

The knowledge base implementation should fire modification events.

I need to talk to Valy about how best to release all these listeners on the GUI
components because otherwise we may have memory leaks.
