I need to add support for update events to the Lexicons in gate.lexicon and
then make the GUI's to listen to these events and update themselves. Update of words,
synsets and senses is needed. Also, make the OntoLex editor listen for ontology changes
events.

The knowledge base implementation should fire modification events.

I need to talk to Valy about how best to release all these listeners on the GUI
components because otherwise we may have memory leaks.

Questions about the ontology model:
  - do I need to model isUnique? Did this carry over to OWL?
  - cardinality of properties in OWL? Need to model if there.
  - is Object the best range for a DatatypeProperty? It can be String,
  and the number classes I guess.
  - need to model oneOf list restrictions on properties in classes
  - how to model the differences between toClass, hasClass, hasClassQ, etc. Do
  we need this?

Export of the properties to CGs in the MIAKT modules

Import of the RDF data instances and its export as CGs, assuming the ontology is
already exported. For now will not try to merge ontology with the RDF instance
data.
