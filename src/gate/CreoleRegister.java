/** The CREOLE register records the set of resources that are currently
  * known to the system. Each member of the register is a
  * <A HREF=creole/ResourceData.html>ResourceData</A> object, indexed by
  * the class name of the resource.
  * <P>
  * The register is accessible from the static method
  * <A HREF=Gate.html#getCreoleRegister()>gate.Gate.getCreoleRegister
  * </A>;
  * there is only one per application of the GATE framework.
  * <P>
  * Clients use the register by adding URLs (using the
  * <A HREF=#addDirectory(java.net.URL)>addDirectory</A> method)
  * pointing to CREOLE directories. A <B>CREOLE directory</B> is a URL at
  * which resides a file called <CODE>creole.xml</CODE> describing
  * the resources present, and one or more Jar files implementing
  * those resources. E.g., the CREOLE resources at
  * <A HREF=http://gate.ac.uk/>gate.ac.uk</A> are registered by Gate.init()
  * by registering the directory URL
  * <A HREF=http://gate.ac.uk/creole/>http://gate.ac.uk/creole/</A>, under
  * which lives a file called creole.xml.
  * <P>
  * To register resources clients use the <CODE>registerDirectories</CODE>
  * methods. When resources have been registered they can be accessed via
  * their <CODE>ResourceData</CODE> objects. So a typical use of the register
  * is to: add the set of URLs containing CREOLE directories; register
  * all resources found at those URLs; browse the set of registered
  * resources.
  * <P>
  * In all cases, where a resource or a directory is added which is
  * already present in the register, the new silently overwrites the old.
  *
  * The CreoleRegister notifies all registered listeners of all
  * {@link gate.event.CreoleEvent}s that occur in the system regardless of
  * whether they were initially fired by the {@link Factory}, the
  * {@link DataStoreRegister} or the {@link CreoleRegister} itself.
  *
  * @see gate.Gate
  * @see gate.creole.ResourceData
