  "The memory of Father came back to her. Ever since she had seen him retreat from those "+
  "twelve-year-old boys she often imagined him in this situation: he is on a sinking ship; "+
  "there are only a few lifeboats and there isn't enough room for everyone; there is a "+
  "furious stampede on the deck. At first Father rushes along with the others, but when he "+
  "sees how they push and shove, ready to trample each other under foot, and a wild-eyed "+
  "woman strikes him with her fist because he is in her way, he suddenly stops and steps "+
  "aside. And in the end he merely watches the overloaded lifeboats as they are slowly "+
  "lowered amid shouts and curses, towards the raging waves. "+
  "What name to give to that attitude? Cowardice? No. Cowards are afraid of dying and will "+
  "fight to survive. Nobility? Undoubtedly, if he had acted out of regard for his fellows. "+
  "But Agnes did not believe this was the motive. What was it then? She couldn't say. Only "+
  "one thing seemed certain: on a sinking ship where it was necessary to fight in order to "+
  "boat a lifeboat, Father would have been condemned in advance. "+
  "Yes, that much was certain. The question that arises is htis: had Father hated the people "+
  "on the ship, just as she now hates the motorcyclist and the man who mocked her because "+
  "she covered her ears? No, Agnes cannot imagine that Father was capable of hatred. "+
  "Hate traps us by binding us too tightly to our adversary. This is the obscenity of war: "+
  "the intimacy of mutually shed blood, the lascivious of two soldiers who, eye to eye, "+
  "bayonet each other. Agnes was sure: it is precisely this kind of intimacy that her "+
  "father found repugnant.The melee on the ship filled him with such disgust that he "+
  "preferred to drown. The physical contact with people who struck and trampled and killed "+
  "one another seemed far worse to him than a solitary death in the purity of the waters. "+
  "[p.25-26] "+
  "In our world, where there are more and more faces, more and more alike, it is difficult "+
  "for an individual to reinforce the originality of the self and to become convinced of "+
  "its inimitatable uniqueness. There are two methods for cultivating the uniqueness of the "+
  "self: the method of addition and the method of subtraction. Agnes subtracts from herself "+
  "everything that is exterior and borrowed, in order to come closer to her sheer essence "+
  "(even with the risk that zero lurks at the bottom of subtarction). Laura's method is "+
  "precisely the opposite: in order to make herself even more visible, perceivable, seizable, "+
  "sizeable, she keeps adding to it more and more attributes and she attemptes to identify "+
  "herself with them (with the risk that the essence of the self may be buried by the "+
  "additional attributes). "+
  "Let's take her car as an example. After her divorce, Laura remained alone in a large "+
  "apartment and felt lonely. She longed for a pet to share her solitude. First she thought "+
  "of a dog, but soon realized that a dog needed a kind of care she would be unable to "+
  "provide. And she got a cat. It was a big Siamese cat, beautiful and wicked. As she "+
  "lived with her car and regaled her friends with stories about it, the animal that she "+
  "picked more or less by accident, without any special conviction (after all, her first "+
  "choice was a dog!), took on an evr growing significance: she began to lavish praise "+
  "on her pet and forced everyone to admire it. She saw in the cat a superb independence, "+
  "pride, freedon of action and constancy of charm (so different from human charm, which "+
  "is always spoiled by moments of clumsiness and unattractiveness); in the cat, she saw "+
  "her paradigm; in the cat she saw herself. "+
  " "+
   "The method of addition is quite charming if it involves adding to the self such "+
   "things as a cat, a dog, roast pork, love of the sea or of cold showers. But the matter "+
   "becomes less idyllic if a person decides to add love for communism, for the homeland, "+
   "for Mussolini, for Roman Catolicism or atheism, for facism or antifacism. In both cases "+
   "the method remains exactly the same: a person stubbornly defending the superiority of "+
   "cats over other animals is doing basically the same as the one who maintains that "+
   "Mussolini was the sole saviour of Italy: he is proud of this attribute of the self and "+
   "he tries to make this attribute (a cat or Mussolini) acknowledged or loved by everyone. "+
   "Here is that strange paradox to which all people cultivating the self by way of the "+
   "addition method are subject: they use addition in order to create unique, inimitable "+
   "self, yet because they automatically become prpagandists for the added attributes, they are "+
   "actually doing everything in their power to make as many others as possible similar "+
   "to themselves; as a result, their uniqueness (so painfully gained) quickly begins to disappear. "+
   "We may ask ourselves why a person who loves a cat (or Mussolini) is not satisfied to "+
   "keep his love to himself, and wants to force it on others. Let's seek the answer by "+
   "recalling the young woman in the sauna, who belligerently asserted that she loved "+
   "cold showers. She thereby managed to differentiate herself at once from one half of the "+
   "human race, namely the half that prefers hot showers. Unfortunately, that other half "+
   "resembled her all the more. Alas, how sad! Many people, few ideas, so how are we "+
   "differentiate ourselves from each other? The young woman knew only one way of overcoming "+
   "the disadvantage of her similarity to that enourmous throng devoted to cold showers: "+
   "she had to proclaim her credo \"I adore cold showers!\" as soon as she appeared in the "+
   "door of the sauna and to proclaim it with such fervour as to make the millions of other "+
   "women who also enjoy cold showers seem like pale imitations of herself. Let me put it "+
   "another way: a mere (simple and innocent) love for showers can become an attribute "+
   "of the self only on condition that we let the world we are ready to fight for it. "+
   "The one who chooses as an atrtibyte of the self a love for Mussolini becomes a "+
   "political warrior, while the partisan of cats, music or antique furniture bestows "+
   "gifts on his surroundings. "+
