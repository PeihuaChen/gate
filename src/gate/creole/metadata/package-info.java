/**
 * This package contains Java 5 annotation types that can be used
 * to annotate the classes that implement CREOLE resources as an
 * alternative to writing a creole.xml file by hand.  The annotations
 * are not read at runtime - the creole.xml file is still used but
 * it is generated automatically from the annotations rather than
 * being written by hand.
