<H3>Time vs. Character Offsets</H3>

<P>
Where we say "temporal offset" this should generally be taken to by
synonymous with "character offset", except where made clear by context. The
usage is driven by the fact that the AGs formalism uses "temporal" where it
might have been better to use "offset".


<H3>Anchoring</H3>

<P>
Probably we should assume that all our AGs are at least minimally anchored,
i.e. there are no dangling nodes with indeterminate offset.


<H3>Spans</H3>

<P>
In a minimally anchored AG (Bir99 p.31) there is always some offset
information about the position of a node, though this may need to be inferred
by traversing the graph until an anchored node is encountered. In the textual
case, the values can often be calculated at creation time by reference to the
text. The getStart()/getEnd() methods of Annotation may cache this value at 
creation time and recalculate it in face of edits.


<H3>Missing</H3>

<P>
Type precedence (Bir99 p. 38).
