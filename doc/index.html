<!-- licence ******************************************************** -->
<A NAME="licence"></A><H2>Embedding GATE in other software systems</H2>

<P>
GATE is licenced under the 
<A HREF=../licence.html>GNU Library General Public License</A>,
version 2 of June 1991 (referred to as "The GNU License" below).

<P>
Under the terms of the GNU License, the source code of a system that
uses GATE as a library
consitutes "a work that uses the library" and
is therefore exempt from the terms of the license. Executables
of embedding systems (that are linked with GATE)
constitute "an executable that is derivative of the library" and
are subject to the terms of clause 6 of the GNU License. This
clause requires that if these executables are
redistributed they must include a copy of GATE (both binary and source),
a copy of the GNU License attached to that copy, and give notice
that GATE
used within it, including this information in any display of copyright
notices given by the embedding system.

<P>
If you modify GATE, you must: clearly mark what modifications you made (e.g.
in the headers of the files you changed), and you must make those
modifications available free to anyone who wants them. This <B>does not
apply</B> to work that is identifiably not part of the library, such as
components you may write that are loaded with GATE at runtime. The license
does not affect your rights to this work, only to modifications to the core
GATE system itself.

<P>
Basically, you can use GATE in another system as you like. The only
restriction is that if you distribute binaries that incorporate GATE,
you must also include copies of GATE, and you must acknowledge your 
use of our system.


<!-- contribute ******************************************************* -->
<A NAME="contribute"></A><H2>Contributing</H2>

<P>
We welcome input to the development process of GATE, and the
system has been designed with development outside Sheffield 
very much in mind. The ideal way to run distributed development is
probably anonymous CVS, but although we use CVS internally,
due to security problems with anonymous CVS we cannot provide this
facility at present. Instead we make the current version available 
nightly on the ftp site. The procedure, then, for submitting changes to
the system, is to:

<UL>
<LI>
take a version from the ftp site (accessible via
<A HREF=http://gate.ac.uk/download/>http://gate.ac.uk/download/</A>)
<LI>
make changes as required, keeping a note of <B>all files added or deleted</B>
(note our <A HREF=codestyle.html>coding guidelines</A>)
<LI>
when you're happy with your code, send us back the complete
system, with the list of new and deleted files
<LI>
we will examine your changes, run the test suite against it and so on,
and if possible integrate it with the main code base
<LI>
as soon as we integrate your changes they will become available to
other users via the ftp site.
</UL>

We will be happy to discuss closer working relationships with those
who contribute successful modifications to the system.
