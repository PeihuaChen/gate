<H2>Reporting bugs</H2>

<P>
First please search the tables below to make sure the bug isn't already
known. Second check the documentation and ensure that you're running on a
supported version of Java, have the right environment variables set and so
on. Third, consider joining the
<A HREF="http://www.peak.org/cgi-bin/majordomo?gate-discuss:dcs.shef.ac.uk">gate-discuss mailing list</A>
and getting help there. Finally, if all else fails, send us a bug report as
described below.

<P>
Please send us a table entry like the following, giving details such as:
GATE version and build number; whether
you built from source or used a binary; what OS you're using, and which JDK;
on UNIX, which windowing system.
<PRE>

<H2>Fixing bugs</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Adopt the bug by filling in the "Adopted by" column and checking in this
file.
<LI>
Duplicate the bug; if you cannot, mail the person who submitted it and ask
them to clarify. If it was fixed in the current version just add "Fixed
on..." column.
<LI>
Add any necessary supporting materials in the bugs directory under the bug
number.
<LI>
Add a test to the test suite that reproduces the bug and add the name of the
test to the "Test method" column. If the bug can ONLY be reproduced by the
GUI, then say "GUI only" in this column.
<LI>
Fix the bug; run all the tests.
<LI>
Fill in the rest of the table, move the entry to the "fixed" table

AnnotationSetImpl:
<BR>
Various get() methods return the actual set stored in the indexes internal
to AnnotationSetImpl.
If such a set obtained from a get() operation is then modified, the
modification will be reflected by the results of all the further calls to
the same get() method although the base AnnotationSet is not actually
modified, hence invalid results.
<BR>
Probably the desired behaviour is for the returned annotation sets to be
backed by the base annotation set so that modifications on the returned sets
will reflect in the base set. That could cause a lot of
ConcurrentModificationExceptions in the client code but that's their
problem.

    <TD><p>The GUI doesn't block while operations are being executed. This
    allows for multiple threads to be run at the same time which could lead to
    dangerous situations as the gate API is not thread safe. Although runing
    things that not affect each other is many times safe it is sometimes
    difficult to tell whether two certain operations are interfering with each
    other so the GUI should lock itself not allowing the user to start a new
    operation before the current one finished.</p>

    Kalina's note: I think that such operations should not be performed in a separate thread allowing the user to control the GUI. Instead they should pop up a dialog telling the user theu have to wait. The problem otherwise:

- I do not know when the save is finished, so I close the document while it's still being saved. What happens is cleanup() gets called, which remoes the data before it's saved.


    <P><font color="green"><B>Workaround:</b> Allow each operation to finish before starting
    a new one. This is particularly important for operations involving
    datastores and executions of applications.

    <TD>there is a problem with the OKCancelDialog and the tabbed panel it puts inside. Basically, because the tabbedPabel grows to fit the size of the editors, this creates a problem when these editors exceed the screen. The dialog does not fit on it any more and the tabs are gone, you cannot see anything!
    All of this is due to the token sets of annotations that you add on the sentence annotations. If easier, maybe change those to annotation Ids instead and avoid tackling the issue, because it only occurs when the annotation has an excessively long feature. Whatever.</TD>
    <TD>Run Nerc on a document of choice, then double click any Sentence.
At that point, the treeviewer gets constructed on the first pane and Cristi&prime;s annotation viewer gets constructed in the next. However, his viewer does not control its Size and Preferred size, neither it has a scroller. So the tab panel decides to make itself as big as his viewer and nothing shows on screen, because the treeviewer is only small and is not visible, just as the tabs themselves.</TD>

   <TD>Fixed on<BR></TD>
   <TD>When I attempt to load a GATE document language resource via the GATE GUI (i.e., click on the "open folder" icon for the sourceUrl property), my screen is filled with a simple blue background (and this background spans multiple "virtual" desktops in my X-Windows session, using the FVWM window manager). No Java Swing widgets are visible on this background (making it impossible to do anything, much less load a document). I have also tried this with the Sun CDE window manager. In that case, a gray window fills just my current desktop, again with no Java widgets (and thus no way to do anything). This problem does not arise on Windows 2000 (JDK
1.3.1_01) (which is not my preferred platform), and I did not have this problem on Solaris when using GATE 2.0 a3build516.</TD>

    <TD>I tried to change the colour of one of the annotations (by selecting red instead of pale yellow as the background) and to my surprise, it made all  those annotations disappear completely! And I couldn&prime;t even change the colour back to something else, as it wouldn&prime;t let me..... Bizarre, as it used to work fine. I tested it several times and got the same thing every time.

    <TD>When you select all the loaded documents and then do Close All, and then exit
Gate, it doesn't appear to have removed the documents properly, because it
saves them before it exits, and then reloads them when you start Gate again.<br>
same story here and it happens with PRs (sometimes), applications (almost
always) and with corpora (almost always, but only an empty corpus is loaded, i.e. containing no documents)

I guess it&prime;s relevant to when GATE tries to persist the settings (and that somehow sometimes it fails to do so)

    <TD>
 We need separate panels for the key and response annotations in
 the adiff display, with their own horizontal scrolling, so that we can
 get both on the same screen when the features lists are long

 We must show the string for each annotation, because as it is, the ADIFF panel is anything but informative. When I analyse the OM errors for example, I have to keep swapping between the Document viewer where I can see the strings and the adiff, in order to discover why something might have gone wrong. That's not more than 30 mins work that will improve the life of people doing PR debugging increadibly. I volunteer to do it.</TD>

    <TD>1. Search - allows you to find a string in the DocumentViewer/Editor. Vitally needed when marking up text. For example, you want to markup all occurences of 'he'. The only way to do that now is to read the entire text. Maybe it should be easier than that.

technical difficulty: very low (content.indexOf (given string) + do
highlight)
<br>
2. Corpus/save preserving format - same as the existing save as XML functionality, just slightly different method call. Just new entry on the menu.

technical difficulty: low
<br>
3. make the action menu for resources a separate class and that gets constructed from actions exposed on the resources themselves. Valy says that's a really good idea and not difficult to implement. The nice thing about it is that it'll reduce the overhead of adding new types of LRs like Wordnet to the GUI with no programming effort on behalf of the user.

technical difficulty: medium (Valy knows exactly how but just not enough time till the beta; suggests done in January, before final release).

    <TD>The profiler shows that obtaining beanInfo on each class is an expensive operation. I minimised that to an extent now by stopping it from being read for every parameter. Hopefully now it's read once parameters need to be set. However, still this is not needed, because the beanInfo does not change once the class is loaded.

So how about making a static on each Resource, which when it gets constructed, it checks and if the static is null -> creates the BeanInfo, if not, does nothing. That might speed up the things even more. Probably not worth trying till January, but something to keep in mind.

Valentin's note: how often do we set parameters on resources? Is it worth the while?

    <TD>The idea is to have a file in the corpus directory which is either empty, then process the entire doc or contains the string of the annotation name which should be the BODY annotation in annotation set transfer.

The problem is that without AST, precision and recall are lower by about 5% from the real figures.

Should fix as soon as Oana has fixed the entire corpus.

Diana's note:
.....would be very happy later on if it were allowed to process just the main
body of the documents and not the whole thing, by allowing you to specify the
tag to be used for the annotation set transfer.

    <TD>it looks like the FeatureMap is not working properly</TD>
    <TD>the following code:


-------------------------------
String strPronoun = (String)currPronoun.getFeatures().get(TOKEN_STRING);

  System.out.println("key=["+TOKEN_STRING+"]");
  System.out.println("value ["+currPronoun.getFeatures().get(TOKEN_STRING)+"]");
  System.out.println("features=["+currPronoun.getFeatures()+"]");
-------------------------------

produces:

============================
key=[string]

value [null]

features=[{category=PRP$, kind=word, string=its, length=3, orth=lowercase}]  ============================

i.e. getting the value for the key "string" fails, wlthough it seems that this key/velue pair exists in the feature map

the code in feature Map for toString() and get() is totally different, that's why one works and other not


more weird details:

- the code works in the debugger, and when used standalone (from TestCoref, not as PR from GATE UI) which implies synchronization problems

- on the other hand I can't see a scenario where these four consecutive lines of the execution are interfered by another thread

    <TD>running on the OB set with default resources, I get the exception
below. not sure if the preceding exceptions are relevant; the last one happens at line 22 of

 1  // FinalYearOnlyFinalActionClass143

 2  package japeactionclasses;

 3  import java.io.*;

 4  import java.util.*;

 5  import gate.*;

 6  import gate.jape.*;

 7  import gate.annotation.*;

 8  import gate.util.*;

10  public class FinalYearOnlyFinalActionClass143

11  implements java.io.Serializable, RhsAction {

12    public void doit(Document doc, AnnotationSet annotations,
java.util.Map bindings) {

13  //removes TempDate annotation, gets the rule feature and adds a new Date annotation

14  gate.AnnotationSet date = (gate.AnnotationSet)bindings.get("date");

15  gate.Annotation dateAnn = (gate.Annotation)date.iterator().next();

16  gate.FeatureMap features = Factory.newFeatureMap();

17  features.put("rule1", dateAnn.getFeatures().get("rule"));

18  features.put("rule2", "YearOnlyFinal");

19  features.put("kind", "date");

20  annotations.add(date.firstNode(), date.lastNode(), "Date",

21  features);

22  annotations.removeAll(date);

23

24    }

25  }

Diana&prime;s note (unlikely though):
The problem is badly written Java code on the RHS of a rule (my fault!) It was  trying to get a feature and value ("rule" in this case) that didn't
exist

17  features.put("rule1", dateAnn.getFeatures().get("rule"));

because of a previous rule in another grammar where the feature should have
been added but hadn't been.

Of course, I should have ensured that it only looks for features if they
exist :-)

    <TD>When doing corpus annotation with GATE, i.e. correcting ANNIE's wrong annotations, what you often do is want to delete a wrong annotation and then mark it up correctly. The second part was made easy by Cristi. The first part: deleting an annotation is difficult.

you have to have the annotations table on, then click on the annotation text, then choose the annotation type, get positioned in the table (which is slow and confusing on long documents) just to press delete. The problem is that linguists don't care about all the internal features produced by GATE most of the time.

Suggestion: add a menu of actions for each annotation type (delete and select for now). It'll take longer to explain in writing but Valy agrees it's a good idea to bypass the complex delete procedure. It will not be computationally more expensive and will only take 10 mins to implement (as a pessimist I say 30).</TD>
