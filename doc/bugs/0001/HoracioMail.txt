Hello Hamish and Valy,

I had a problem when working with jape over HTML annotations produced by the
tsa.

- problem1: annotation not recognized

input text: p24.html
grammar: does_not_annotate.jape
tokeniser: default (can be active or not)

The text contains an annotation of type "img" that is not recognized,
nevertheless the LHS contain that type

- problem2: loop in FS machine from jape grammar

input text: p24.html
grammar: jape_loop.jape
tokenise: default (can be active or not)

The grammar contains only one rule that ask for the annotation type "a", it
loops.

Particularities: annotations "a" and "img" have length 0 and "cover"  the
same
text span.

I've tried with other texts and the same problem occurs.
I haven't tried all the html annotations but some of them get recognized.

Please let me know if there is something wrong with the rules.
Thanks in advance,

Horacio.

 Abstract

  Sony's AIBO entertainment robot has broken all records for the number of
   robots sold in the shortest time period. The AIBO is an autonomous home
 entertainment robot with artificial intelligence. Its behavior simulates a
dog's in its ability to walk and play, with built-in functions for emotions,
  instincts, learning and growth. Yet AIBO was not intended by Sony to be a
dog substitute, but to further the man-robot interaction. It has received an
  overwhelming response worldwide and it appears as if AIBO may be just the
               beginning of Sony's home entertainment robots.

1999 marked the first year that the prestigious World Robotics, a
one-of-a-kind annual publication put together by the Economic Commission for
Europe (ECE) and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), included a
survey on service robots. Included in this premier report were entertainment
robots, which, coupled with a few other new service robot classifications,
were forecast to total 1,000 installations for the period 1999-2002.

This prediction was surpassed - five times the forecast amount - in just
four days in June 1999 by one robot alone - the AIBO entertainment robot.
Further, what no one was able to predict, including Sony Corporation, the
manufacturer, was that the AIBO also broke all records for the greatest
amount of robots sold in the shortest amount of time. The first run of 5,000
AIBOs, the ERS-110, was met with an overwhelming response - one that almost
broke Sony's Webserver: 3,000 sold out in Japan in 20 minutes on the
Internet and the remaining 2,000, made available only in the USA, were all
sold on the Internet within four days.

To respond to the consumer demand, 10,000 of a slightly modified edition of
the AIBO, the ERS-111 (see Plate 1), were offered for sale in November 1999
via the Internet in the USA, Japan and Europe (Austria, Greece, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain,
Switzerland, the UK, Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden and Norway). "Adoption
agreement" order forms were taken over a ten-day period. Sony received
135,000 orders and the 10,000 lucky customers were picked at random.

In the third and most recent sale held in February 2000, there was no limit
on the number of AIBOs available and plans were, according to Sony, to
manufacture an AIBO for every order received during the official order
period. As of October 2000, Sony has yet to release the formal sales figures
from the last sale or any dates for a future production run.

All robots have been at a price tag of US$2,500 with an additional US$500
for a performer kit, a motion editor software option. Financing was
available for the first time on the AIBO Web site during the February 2000
sale through Sony Finance, although fewer then ten consumers actually took
advantage of this option.

Why is the AIBO so successful?

It is the first autonomous home entertainment robot to utilize artificial
intelligence (AI). Hence, part of the name derivation - "AI", pronounced
"eye" since it is also a robot with eyes, with the "BO" coming from robot.
Aibo also means partner or pal in Japanese.

Mechanically, the 3.5lb AIBO has 18 motors, three in the head, three in each
of the four legs, two in the tail, and one in the mouth, that altogether
produce a total of 250 types of movement. It has 16MB of RAM, a 64-bit MIPS
RISC processor, and a removable Sony "memory stick" with 8MB of flash memory
that stores Aperios, Sony's new real-time embedded operating system. The
robot also has a 7.2V lithium ion battery that lasts about 1.5 hours, a
180,000 pixel CCD color camera, two stereo microphones, one speaker, two
heat sensors, an infra-red range finder, four spatial acceleration sensors,
one angular velocity sensor, and four switch pressure sensors.

Toshitada Doi, the creator of AIBO, recently described AIBO in a Japanese
newspaper article entitled "Matrix":

AIBO is equipped with six emotions (joy, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and
discontent) and four instincts (the desire to interact with people, to
search for favorite objects, to move around, and to re-charge its battery).
These values constantly change depending on the external stimulation and its
own movements. When it is praised, loved, or fulfills its desire, the
happiness value increases. On the other hand, when its desire is not met,
its sadness and anger values increase. When it barks, its anger subsides.

The "character" of AIBO is what determines the relation of the sensor input
and values, and the relation of the pattern of activities and values. The
character is displayed in a numerical value in matrix format.

The character of AIBO is ever changing. If AIBO is well interacted with, it
will be active and lovable. However, if ignored, AIBO will become lazy and
not react to people.

Additionally, there is a growth pattern programmed in correlation to the
hours and ways AIBO is raised (baby stage, child stage, youth stage and
adult stage). AIBO's movements rapidly change in compliance with this
growth.

Compared to a live creature, AIBO is definitely simplified (Plate 2). But
when you spend some time with it, it is strange that you become attached.
Its program and inner conditions are stored to a small device called the
memory stick. If you analyze this, you are immediately able to determine how
AIBO has been raised. The matrix that represents AIBO's character is clear
and evident too.

Is AIBO a fad, a fascination, or is it the future of our pet relationships?

It appears that AIBO may be just the beginning of the home entertainment
robots. After one and a half years since its birth, AIBO still seems to be
in high demand and, for some owners, AIBO has become a lifestyle. There are
AIBO expos and clinics where one can bring one's AIBO for an annual checkup.
There are AIBO chat rooms, soccer tournaments, ClubAIBO, and a soon-to-be
published AIBO Town Magazine.

Despite many who purchased the AIBO because their living situation was not
conducive for a biological pet, Sony did not intend for AIBO to replace the
living pet. "Our researchers know the limitations of a machine", comments
Yosh Kambe of Sony Marketing, whose title is AIBO keeper. "We just want to
add a new type of companion for future millennium life. We have no intention
of competing with the real animal companion. That's our long-term goal -
living with robots. It's not just playing with toys - it's more serious. We
are dreaming of how we are going to live with robots in our future life."

And the future is now what Sony is focusing on. There are potential future
enhancements for AIBO that the Tokyo development team is considering, such
as voice recognition and image recognition, but there are no formal
announcements as of yet. Opening up the market to other continents and
countries, such as Asia and more European countries, is also a possibility.
Sony is working on potential other types of entertainment robots, but there
are no specific plans to release a different type of robot
