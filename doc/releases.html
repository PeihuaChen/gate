<!-- release notes *************************************************** -->
<H2>GATE 4.0 (build 2752), July 12th 2007</H2>

<P>GATE version 4 is now available for download from Sourceforge
(follow the download link from <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/download">http://gate.ac.uk/download</a>).</P>

<P>Version 4 includes major new facilities for annotation indexing
and search, machine learning, scaleable ontology support from OWLIM (<a
	hred="http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/">http://www.ontotext.com/owlim/</a>
), ontology-based document annotation, and parallel corpus alignment.
There is a raft of efficiency and infrastructure improvements including
revamped HTML handling, Java 5 support and numerous optimisations and
bug fixes. The set of plugins available has expanded to include around
150 components, which integrate with many high-quality language
processing tools from the wider research community (<a
	href="http://gate.ac.uk/gate/doc/plugins.html">http://gate.ac.uk/gate/doc/plugins.html</a>).</P>

<P>GATE is free and open (under the LGPL licence) and you are very
welcome to use it for both commercial and research purposes. A number of
businesses now use GATE in production applications, from large
corporates like Thompson or AT&T to startups like Garlik or Innovantage.
Research, teaching and student users represent a high proportion of labs
working on language and knowledge worldwide. </P>


<P>Plans for the future include:
<ul>
	<li>a new version of the JAPE finite state annotation processing
language</li>
	<li>more and better integration with related systems and tools</li>
	<li>SAFE, the Semantic Annotation Factory Environment: <a href="http://gate.ac.uk/safe/">http://gate.ac.uk/safe/</a></li> 
</ul>
</P>

<P>See <a href=http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/#chap:changes>the changelog</a> for 
more details.</P>

<P>GATE is developed on Ubuntu (and other less advanced operating systems).</P>

<H2>GATE 3.1 (build 2270), April 7th 2006</H2>

<p>This is the final release of version 3.1.
<p>New features in 3.1 (see also next section) include:
<ul>
	<li>UIMA interoperability layer, paid for by IBM's TJ Watson labs
	(thanks folks!)
	<li>a revised and reworked ontology abstraction API that
	generalises over Sesame, JENA and KAON for language technology purposes
	
	<li><a href=http://www.ontotext.com/gate/japec.html>OntoText's
	new JAPE compiler</a>, which makes ANNIE run 200% as fast as previously and
	in general achieves JAPE speed-ups of 2-5 times.
</ul>
...and a whole bunch of bug fixes!

<p>There are a few backwards incompatibilities (see <a
	href=http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/#chap:changes>the changelog</a> for

	href=http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao/#chap:changes>the changelog</a> for

release and supercedes all previous versions.
<P>New features include:
<ul>
	<li>completely rewritten document viewer/editor
	<li>extensive ontology support
	<li>a new plugin management system
	<li>lots more CREOLE plugins, including Chemistry Tagger, Montreal
	Transducer, RASP Parser, MiniPar, Buchart Parser, MinorThird, NP
	Chunker, Stemmer, TreeTagger, Probability Finder, Crawler, Google PR,
	SVM Light, ...
	<li>faster JAPE compiles, and removal of dependency on Sun Java
	compiler
	<li>separate .jar files and Tomcat classloading fixes
	<li>transparent XML-based application serialisation
</ul>
See
<a href=http://gate.ac.uk/sale/tao>chapter 2 (Change Log)</a>
of the User Guide for full details of what has changed.

<p><b>Compatibility:</b> for version 3 we decided that it was
worthwhile making a few incompatible changes in order to clean up a
couple of things that have caused trouble in previous versions. For
example: some recent classes have been renamed (particularly the
ontologies support classes); a few new events have been added;
datastores created by version 3 will probably not read properly in
version 2. If you have problems use the <a
	href=http://gate.ac.uk/mail/index.html>mailing list</a> and we'll help
you fix your code!
<p>Version 3.1 will be a bug fix and minor adjustments to new
features release; <a href=http://gate.ac.uk/mail/index.html>send us
your comments</a>.
<p>GATE is free software, developed using public research funds. If
you find it useful, don't keep it a secret!
<p>Thought for the day: did you know that if Walt Disney was working
now, most of his films would be illegal? Check out <a
	href=http://www.eff.org />the Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, or take a
look at Lessig's <b>Free Culture</b>. <!-- release notes *************************************************** -->
<H2>GATE 3.0 (build 1810, Release Candidate 1), December 7th 2004</H2>

<p>Since beta 1 of version 3 we have stabilised the system, and made
all pre-release final changes. This RC1 release is for testing of the
installation routines and backwards compatibility analysis. Please
report all bugs and errors. Version 3.0 FCS will be very early 2005. <!-- release notes *************************************************** -->
<H2>GATE 3.0 (build 1717, Beta 1), August 6th 2004</H2>

<p>This release is dedicated to the memory of Jeremy Black (main
instigator of the <a href=http://www.gate.ac.uk/projects/etcsl />ETCSL
projects</a>).
<P>This is the latest release (is it <b>not</b> production quality).
