<H1> Name Matcher </H1>

<H2> Overview </H2>
<P> The Name Matcher module aims to recognise relations between
previously recognised entities. It may also assign an entity type to a previously
unclassified name, based on a relation with an existing entity. It may
not, however, reclassify any other previously classified entity.
</P>

<H2> Resources</H2>
<P> The Name Matcher uses an external lookup list of aliases to record non-matching
strings which represent the same entity, e.g. "New York" and "The Big
Apple"; "Coca Cola" and "Coke". This table is used only for the case
where no rules would apply, because the two strings are too
dissimilar. It would not be used to record acronyms or shorter forms,
e.g. "ICI" and "Imperial Chemical Industries". It also uses several
other external lists for things like prepositions which are used in
the rules.
</P>

<H3>Options</H3>
<P>
The Name Matcher also makes use of lists such as company
designators. These can be loaded in two ways: either from a set of
specific external lists, or from the results of the earlier gazetteer lookup
module. The switch is set at runtime, i.e. via the UsedComponents menu
which appears when the NameMatcher is added to the application.
The option "extLists" should be set to true for the former and
false for the latter.  By default, the latter will be used. An
alternative AnnotationSet and AnnotationType names can also be
specified at this point; otherwise the default set will be used. Some rules 
are only applied for the annotations that are organisations or persons. So, 
it is necessary to specify the type of the organisation or the person. By default, 
these are Organization and Person. 
The user can choose a document from a list with all the documents of the application; otherwise the current document will be the last element from the list. By default, the annotation set is the default annotation set of the document, but the user also can specify the name of the annotation set.

<H2> Rules </H2>
<P>
The Name Matcher recognises relations between entities based on a
number of handcoded rules, detailed below. The rules may be applied to
annotations produced by the JAPE transducer for people (P), organisations (O) or to all
types of annotations (A). The rules may be case-dependent or
case-independent, and may consist of full or partial matches between
entities, and are both transitive and bi-directional. This means 
<UL>
<LI>
IF name1 matches name2 by ruleA AND name2 matches name3 by ruleB THEN
name1 also matches name3 
</LI>
<LI>
IF name1 matches name2 by ruleA, THEN name2 also matches name1 by ruleA
</LI>
</UL>
</P>
Types of match:
<UL>
<LI>
Full: 
	<UL>
	<LI>
	A and B are identical (with or without case matching)
	<BR> e.g. <I>WHSmith</I> and <I>WHSMITH</I>
	</LI>
	</UL>
<LI>
Partial: 
	<UL>
	<LI>
	A contains B
	<BR> e.g. <I>WHSmith Ltd.</I> and <I> WHSmith</I>
	</LI>
	<LI>
         A can be transformed into B (e.g. reversal around a
preposition)
	<BR> e.g. <I>Defense Department</I> and <I>U.S. Department of Defense</I>
	</LI>
         <LI>
	A is a concatenated contraction of B
	<BR> e.g. <I>Pan American</I> and <I>Pan Am</I>
	</LI>
	</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
Semantic:
	<UL>
	<LI>
	 A is an alias of B but bears no orthographical resemblance
	<BR> e.g. <I>New York</I> and <I>The Big Apple</I>
	</LI>
	</UL>
</LI>
<LI>
No match:
	<UL>
	<LI>A is a spurious match of B
	<BR> e.g. <I>Eastern Airways</I> and <I>Eastern Air</I> (which
are different companies)
	</LI>
	</UL>
</UL>

The matching rules are hard-coded in the Namematcher, as is priority
handling of rules. Essentially, the first rule to be applied is the spurious rule
from the lookup list (where two names are listed specifically as not
matching), followed by the rules for all annotations, organizations,
and persons respectively. In general, rules matching more similar
strings precede those matching less similar ones.


<H2> Classification of Unknown Entities </H2>
<P>
The namematcher also checks entities marked as "Unknown" to see if
they match any entities of type "Person", "Location" or
"Organization", according to the rules described above. If a match is
found, the "Unknown" annotation is deleted, and the entity is
reannotated with the same type as that of its matching entity.
</P>

<H2> Maintenance </H2>
<P>
The external list switch enables specific changes to be made to the
lists of company designators etc. without having to either rebuild the
NameMatcher or modify the gazetteer lists (which may have implications
on the transduction phase). Using the gazetteer lists, on the other
hand, prevents the need for updating the external lists independently
every time the gazetteer lists are modified. 

The structure of the external lists is as follows. The lists are
stored as separate files, with an index file NMlists.def in which the
list names are defined (as for the gazetteer lists). Each entry in a
list consists of a name, a separator "£" and an identifier (generally
a number, though it can be any token or string. The identifier is used
to match entries, i.e. all entries with the same identifier are to be
considered as related. For lists such as the preposition list, all
entries are considered as equivalent (since there is no special
relation between them other than the fact that they are all
prepositions), so they are all given the same identifier.

The set of "all annotations" to which the rules may be applied is specified in the
AnnotationTypes vector in the Used Components menu - by default this
is Organization, Person and Location. The rules themselves, and their
ordering, are hard-coded and can only be modified via the
Namematch.java code.
