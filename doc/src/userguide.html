<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
GATE, a General Architecture for Text Engineering
\cite{Cun96b,Cun97a,Cun98,Cun99a,Cun00a},
is a software architecture for Language Engineering \cite{Cun99b}.
More specifically, it is three things: an <B>architecture</B>; 
a <B>framework</B>; a <B>development environment</B>.

<P>
By architecture we mean an abstract description of how a language processing
system may usefully be constructed, the types of component typically
used and so on.
By framework we mean an object-oriented class library that implements the
architecture and provides a range of services that are useable in a variety
of application contexts. One such application is a development environment
built on top of the framework. The development environment is analogous to
systems like Mathematica for Mathematicians, or JBuilder for Java
programmers: it provides a convenient graphical environment for research and
development of language processing software.

<P>
Version 1 of GATE was released in 1996. It was written in C++ and Tcl, has
been licenced by several hundred organisations, and used in a wide range of
language analysis contexts including Information Extraction (IE -
\cite{Gai98a,Cun99c}) in English, Greek, Spanish, Swedish, German, Italian and
French.

<P>
Version 2 of GATE was released in Spring 2001. It is written in Java,
and is available as open source free software under the GNU licence
at <A HREF=http://gate.ac.uk/>http://gate.ac.uk/</A>.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3>Architectural principles</H3>

<P>
A central idea behind the GATE architecture is that there should be
no requirement for users to commit to any particular theory of
language processing: the architecture strives to be non-prescriptive and
theory-neutral.

<P>
(Almost) everything in GATE is a component. Components are
reusable software chunks with well-defined interfaces
that are conceptually separate from GATE itself.

<P>
All component sets are user-extensible and together are called CREOLE - a
Collection of REusable Objects for Language Engineering.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3>GATE-based development</H3>

<P>
The framework is a backplane into which plug CREOLE components.

<P>
A set of components plus the framework is a deployment unit.

<P>
The development environment facilitates constructing components.


<P>
The backplane performs these functions:
  component discovery, bootstrapping, loading and reloading;
  native data structures for common information types;
  generalised data storage and process execution.


<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<H3>Component types</H3>

<P>
GATE components are one of three types of specialised Java Beans:
  Processing Resources
  Language Resources
  Visual Resources


<P>
Bits and pieces
  Built in components for common processing and data visualisation tasks
  FST over annotations on text
  Measurement: precision, recall, diff over annotations on text
  Support for documents in XML, SGML, HTML, RTF, email
  Full Unicode

<P>
a CorpusIndex is a type of LanguageResource which is maintained
by a CorpusIndexer, a type of ProcessingResource. (LRs and PRs
are described in one of the sections of my thesis and in 
gate/doc/internal/resources.html; current gate may be checked
out by "cvs co gate", or from a web server at http://gate.ac.uk/gate.)
the purpose of a CorpusIndex is to facilitate
queries relating to Annotations, which are stored in AnnotationSets
that belong to Documents. Annotations have start and end Nodes;
Nodes point into the text via character offsets. various subclasses
of DocumentFormat convert textual markup (like XML, HTML, RTF,
email...) into Annotations when Documents are created. Annotations
each have a type (string) and one or more FeatureMaps associated 
with them encoding the information about text that they hold. 
an example annotation: there is a Token from char 5 to char 10 with
feature "POS" equal to "NN". LanguageResources also have features;
a Corpus might have a feature naming its index, for example.

<PRE>
backplane into which specialised java beans plug;
loose-coupled;
separation of interface and implementation;
inter-component communication is handled by model
  components - LanguageResources, and events;
distribution and parallelism is handled by controller
  components (and by distributing data over HTTP and JDBC)
reason for adding to the normal bean initialisation mech is that
  LRs, PRs and VRs all have characteristic parameterisation
  phases; the GATE resources/components model makes 
  explicit these phases
