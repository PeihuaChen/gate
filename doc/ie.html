<H2>GATE and Information Extraction (IE)</H2>

<P>
GATE was originally developed in the context of IE R&amp;D,
and IE systems in many languages and shapes and sizes have
been created using GATE and the IE components that have been
distributed with it (see <A HREF=papers.html#May00a>Maynard 
et al. 2000</A> for descriptions of some of these projects).

<P>
The principal architects of the IE systems in GATE version 1
were <A HREF=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~robertg>Robert
Gaizauskas</A> and Kevin Humphreys. This work lives on
in the <A HREF=http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/research/projects/all_projects.html>LaSIE
system</A>, and in many design
ideas since taken up in the ANNIE system (see below) and other
IE systems in Sheffield and elsewhere. A derivative of LaSIE was
distributed with GATE version 1 under the name VIE, a Vanilla
IE system.

<P>
GATE version 2 is distributed with an IE system called ANNIE,
A Nearly-New IE system. ANNIE borrows a number of ideas
from LaSIE (and a part-of-speech tagger from 
<A HREF=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~hepple>Mark Hepple</A>),
and contains a number of new ones, including a reliance on
finite state algorithms and the 
<A HREF=papers.html#jape>JAPE language</A> developed 
by <A HREF=http://gate.ac.uk/hamish>Hamish Cunningham</A>
and <A HREF=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~valyt>Valentin Tablan</A>.

<P>
ANNIE is currently a shallow processing system, and not suitable
for event recognition. A full IE pipeline based on a LaSIE backend
with ANNIE shallow analysis looks like this:
